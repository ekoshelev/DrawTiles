Programming Assignment #4, 3/14/16
For the first part of this assignment, I created a TileList class, that makes an ArrayList for 
tiles. Further, it orders and retrieves information on Tiles in the list. Methods return the 
size, tile at an index, move a Tile to the back, and add a tile to the back. My program runs
as it is supposed to.
